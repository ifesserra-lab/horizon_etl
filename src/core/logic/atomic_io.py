"""Atomic file-write helpers.

Writers in this project must never leave a truncated/corrupt file behind:
exports overwrite the previous good version in place, so a crash mid-write
would destroy data. All JSON/artifact writes go through these helpers, which
write to a temporary file in the same directory, fsync it, and atomically
rename it onto the final path.
